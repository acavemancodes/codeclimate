        <h3>MCP seems viral</h3>

        <p>
          MCP (Model Context Protocol)[<a
            href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/"
            >1</a
          >] is all the rage now. Introduced by Anthropic about four months ago,
          it has already been accepted as an open standard and has seen
          widespread adoption, including by major AI companies and prominent AI
          tool makers. There is even a directory[<a href="https://mcp.so/">2</a
          >] listing over 13,000 MCP implementations. Technically, it is a very
          simple API spec that facilitates RPC-like (Remote procedure call)
          communication between an AI and an external system. It enables any
          external system to advertise its capabilities‚Äîreturning information or
          performing various actions‚Äîallowing AI systems to dynamically and
          ‚Äúautomagically‚Äù use those capabilities via API calls.
        </p>

        <h4>An example</h4>

        <p>
          To illustrate, here is a fanciful, but plausible example. Imagine
          three completely independent websites that offer disparate services: a
          travel site, a weather service, and an event booking platform. Each
          could quickly implement a public MCP layer (an HTTP/JSON interface)
          exposing their existing capabilities and functionalities, i.e.,
          information they provide and actions they perform. Below is a highly
          oversimplified mockup in MCP pseudo-parlance:
        </p>

        <h5>Travel</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>check_train_schedule(date, from_place, to_place)</li>
          <li>search_hotels(from_date, to_date, area)</li>
          <li>book_hotel(hotel_name, from_date, to_date, room_type)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Weather</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>get_weather_forecast(date, area)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Events</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>list_events(date, type, area)</li>
          <li>book_event(date, type, number_of_people)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One could then link these websites to their favorite MCP-enabled AI
          (LLM) interface. Plug <code>mcp.travelwebsite.com</code> along with
          endpoints for the other services into the AI‚Äôs interface and et voil√†,
          the AI can now mix and match these capabilities to fulfil one‚Äôs
          arbitrary requests. Below is one such vague prompt that could be typed
          into the AI‚Äôs chat window:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>User:</strong> You know what, I‚Äôm feeling quite adventurous.
          You know my taste in music already. This coming weekend, if there‚Äôs a
          concert I might like within a 4 hour distance, buy tickets for that,
          and book a hotel room and a train there and back the next day. I don‚Äôt
          want to leave home before 8 AM though. If there are no interesting
          concerts, then find a place where the weather will be pleasant. I
          don‚Äôt mind travelling up to 8 hours and staying two extra days. Prefer
          areas known for the kind of food I like.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The AI, via MCP, would then:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Communicate with the three services, parsing their MCP definitions
            (akin to one glancing through technical documentation) and
            understanding their capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Figure out how to mix and match the relevant capabilities to
            retrieve necessary information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use its own vast knowledge as necessary. In this example, the
            knowledge of distance between geographical regions, food and
            cuisines of various regions, and even real-time travel advisory for
            different places.
          </li>
          <li>
            Automatically plan and make the necessary API calls via MCP to
            finally fulfil the user‚Äôs command.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While this example is rather fanciful and prone to going wrong in
          myriad ways, it is already technically feasible. Any system, from a
          travel portal, to one‚Äôs mailbox, calendar, browser, or a code editor
          can be connected to AI via MCP, allowing AI systems to interact with
          them and control them. What is exciting but frightening at the same
          time, is not the example in itself, but the fact that MCP enables AI
          systems to combine real-world services in infinite ways without anyone
          having to manually integrate those services for specific scenarios.
          Integrate, now that is the critically important detail here.
        </p>

        <h4>System Integration</h4>
        <p>
          Beneath nearly every software service‚Äîbe it a weather site, a travel
          portal, or a government tax platform‚Äîlies a Kafkaesque maze of
          interconnections and integrations spanning numerous systems across
          organisations. A significant share of time, code, labour, complexity,
          and cost[<a
            href="https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-system-integration-market"
            >3</a
          >][<a
            href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/system-integrators-market-report"
            >4</a
          >][<a
            href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-system-integration-market-size-172000730.html"
            >5</a
          >] in the global tech industry can be attributed to the painstaking
          process of integrating systems and maintaining these integrations in
          perpetuity.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, a travel site showing weather forecasts must integrate
          with a weather data aggregator, which in turn integrates with regional
          weather data providers, who in turn integrate with on-ground hardware
          systems. The tech world is integration turtles all the way down‚Äîa
          leaky, messy, maintenance-heavy affair colloquially called plumbing.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI‚Äôs ability, via MCP, to read the roster of capabilities that a
          system offers, and to plumb it with other systems instantly, is a
          fundamental, radical departure from how system integration has worked
          at scale, how the tech world operates; no manual coding required. Of
          course, purpose-built, domain-specific, classical system integration
          is not going to go away anytime soon, and while it would be extreme to
          assume that this spells the death of explicit ‚Äúclassical‚Äù system
          integration, it seems logical that over a period of time, an
          increasing number of integrations are going to be auto-plumbed
          dynamically by AI on-demand (or on-whim). It does not matter whether a
          service deals in machine-readable data like JSON or XML, or just
          natural, unstructured human language, the AI system interprets it
          (right or wrong), and makes the integration work without anyone having
          to code anything. In the world of integrations, this is unprecedented.
          As the number of services offering MCP connectivity increases,
          infinite combinatorial possibilities of cross-service functionality
          emerge. Once again, logically, this must eat into explicit system
          integration projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Services on the other hand, the ones who expose their functionality
          via MCP for users to interact via their favorite AI systems, are going
          to exert competitive pressure on their peers to follow suit. It is
          entirely reasonable to imagine that a user would prefer a travel
          portal with which they can interact via their favorite AI assistant
          (‚Äúagentic‚Äù systems, as some say ‡≤†_‡≤†), over one that does not offer
          that. Strictly from a user perspective, it feels liberating to be able
          to access services outside of their walled gardens and bloated UIs
          riddled with dark patterns. It moves a considerable amount of control
          from service providers to users, but at the same time, it concentrates
          decision-making and mediation in the hands of AI blackboxes. What
          about errors and failures with real-world implications that occur in
          the midst of AI orchestration across critical services? How would
          those be debugged and traced? How would accountability be established?
          Will regulations and governance models emerge for AI-mediated
          automagical actions across services? Whether the long-term
          implications of MCP‚Äôs viral, cross-cutting spread will be net positive
          or not, is unclear to me.
        </p>

          (2023), I expressed concern that humans might hastily integrate AI
          blackboxes into critical decision-making systems without forethought,
          gradually eroding human agency and accountability.[<a

        </p>

        <p>
          In an ironic, exciting, and even terrifying twist, humans do not have
          to integrate AI into systems. With MCP, AI systems can now do the
          reverse‚Äîauto-integrate systems into themselves and start calling
          real-world shots, at the same time, significantly diminishing the
          visibility into the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of tangible cross-service actions.
          It also seems plausible that DNS-like ‚Äúrecursive resolver‚Äù mechanisms
          may emerge where AI systems will query directories, discover, and
          auto-add MCP-enabled service to complete their goals, furthering
          virality. For how long will humans be in the loop?
        </p>

        <h4>I am feeling lucky, adventurous</h4>

        <p>
          Google‚Äôs iconic <em>I‚Äôm feeling lucky</em> button turned the abstract
          idea of ‚Äúlucky‚Äù into a simple, predictable, and tangible
          action‚Äîredirecting the user to the first search result. Now, AI
          systems can interpret loose, abstract ideas such as ‚Äúlucky‚Äù or goals
          such as ‚Äúadventure‚Äù in rather mysterious, inscrutable ways. Via MCP,
          AI systems can interact with the external world, turning subjective
          interpretations into real-world actions‚Äîbooking a ticket, ordering
          something,[<a href="https://archive.is/G9bKQ">10</a>] or creating even
          more serious outcomes.[<a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know"
            >11</a
          >] For a variety of use cases, one no longer has to be subject to the
          rigidity and strict confines of UIs offered by services. In a sense,
          this is a shift in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), where services
          can become ‚Äúheadless‚Äù and let users interact with them via subjective
          AI mediation. This in effect allows services and tools to be used in
          ways they were not even designed for. Conceptually, this is not new
          though. There is a big graveyard of past attempts, primarily because
          every imaginable scenario (an Amazon Alexa Skill, for example) had to
          be tailor made and integrated by hand, which is unviable. MCP
          eliminates that obstacle, allowing AI systems to fluidly use external
          capabilities, fueling its virality.

          Speaking of subjective interpretation, out of curiosity, I asked stock

          weekend. What do I do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>GPT-4o:</strong> Given your interests and the current weather
          in Bengaluru (cloudy with potential thunderstorms), here are some
          indoor activities to consider this weekend:

          such as Tech & Gaming and Arts & Culture It subjectively interpreted
          my ‚Äúinterests‚Äù from those couple of lines, automatically pulled
          weather for the area without my mentioning it, searched the web, and
          came up with suggestions. It did this out-of-the-box without my having
          to bring in any MCP plugins, as OpenAI has hand-built these
          integrations internally (which would no longer be necessary, thanks to
          MCP). The missing piece here is an MCP-connected booking service. With
          MCP, the concrete action plan of going to a website, filling a form
          with specific details, sifting through its UI, clicking an explicit
          ‚ÄúBook now‚Äù button and so on, can now be reified from one‚Äôs abstract,
          ambiguous expressions in any manner, in any language.

        <h4>It‚Äôs not even about MCP</h4>

        <p>
          The funny thing is, as a technical construct, there is nothing special
          about MCP. It is a trivial API spec which has in fact suffered from
          poor design and fundamental technical[<a

          even outright gets replaced by some XYZ tomorrow. Questions about
          privacy, security, correctness, and failures will continue to loom for
          a good while, irrespective of whether it is technically MCP or XYZ.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is radical is the core idea‚Äîa trivially implementable open
          standard that lets AI systems interface with the external world. If a
          service already has its functionality exposed via APIs, it is then
          easy to wrap it in an MCP layer and make it ready for AI interactions.
          It is no surprise that the directory already lists 13,000+
          implementations.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a philosophical level, I think it is a useful thought experiment to
          analyse MCP, or whatever avatar it takes tomorrow, not as a
          conventional technical standard, but because of the fluidity it
          enables, as a loose, social contract between real-world services and
          AI systems, facilitated at the behest of users (or AI systems
          themselves tomorrow). Unlike the classical hand-made, explicit,
          per-use-case system integrations, MCP allows an infinite number of
          combinatorial outcomes to arise from arbitrary, self-assembling
          integrations that nobody ever even imagined. If AI is a blackbox, AI
          systems interfacing with the world via MCP, abstracting complexity to
          an unprecedented degree, feels like a black hole of recursive
          machine-induced fever dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
          In essence, MCP is enabling a global, interconnected, self-organising
          meta system that can behave in unpredictable ways. Picture an
          intangible subjective blackbox network in the sky with the ability to
          execute actions across random real-world systems. One might
          imaginatively call it ‚Ä¶ SkyNet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I jest, of course, fully aware that this post is tinted more with
          alarm and a touch of the dramatic, than with excitement about
          technical gadgetry, though I do feel that excitement to a fair extent
          as well.
